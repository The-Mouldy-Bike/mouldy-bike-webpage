							<h2>Playdates</h2>

								Me and Joe used to invite friends over after school<br /> under false pretences.
							</p>
							<p>
								We promised we’d play tip the can.<br /> We promised we’d play football. <br />Instead we had them act in short ﬁlms<br /> which we co-wrote as we went.
							</p>
							<p>
								We had Reilly stripped to the waist<br />  on location in the ruins of a nearby famine village.<br /> He played a superhero <br /> doing push-ups in some long-dead family’s living room,<br /> swinging from trees in their garden.
							</p>
							<p>
								He protested and protested<br />  said it was stupid and none of his other friends did this <br /> but he was outnumbered and lacking vision.
							</p>
							<p>
								Liam played a crazed puppeteer<br />   in a documentary charting his rise and fall.<br /> We taped socks to his hands for the puppets.<br />  When the fame gets too much, the puppeteer unravels,<br />  so we pinned him down and tickled<br />   until the madness came through.
							</p>
							<p>
								Working with amateurs proved frustrating.<br />  Little Michael was useless as a Western lead. <br /> Blind without his glasses, devoid of charisma, timid as shit<br />  we had him smoke ﬁve of my father’s John Majors<br />  until his performance developed some grit.
							</p>
							<p>
								Quiet Ken was awarded our most challenging role-<br /> unable to convince us he was not a method actor<br /> he mimed the Velvet Underground’s ‘White Heat. White Light.’ <br />into a blinking lens for three and a half hours<br /> until he ﬁnally winked at the right time.<br /> Then we made him drop acid, strip to his jocks<br /> and cluck like a chicken in the coop<br />  with the rest of the chickens.<br /> Then we made him lay an egg.
							</p>
							<p>
								Brendan got bit by an aggravated dog<br /> in a failed escape from the plantation.<br /> Brian took the beatings like a silent champ<br />  in a piece which tackled domestic abuse.<br /> Timothy refused to do the shower scene.<br /> William cried and went home.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mom found the videos and deleted them all,<br /> Rang Joe’s mother and a counsellor. <br />Now I don’t see Joe anymore <br />and nobody comes over after school. <br />Tip the can is shit alone <br />so I kick the ball through every window in the house<br /> and go inside to watch Le Regle du Jeu.
