								<h3><b>Nov 3, 2003: </b></h3>
								<p>
									I wasn’t prepared for the loss of my usual routine heading into college. The old rhythms and movements. I felt lost without it, to be honest with ye, like I’d lost some core structure that the rest of me was hung around. But I made up for it fairly quickly. I’ve built up a new schedule and a new me has become to form around it. Always thought it’d be the other way around.
								</p>
								<p>
									Football training is Monday and Wednesday evenings. This is my favourite part of my new life, if only because it's the most familiar,  the main holdover from my old one. Was important to me to ﬁnd some sort of terrain I could navigate, feel at ease on, before I headed into the wilderness. Though I’m playing with new people it’s easy, comfortable territory. Same plays, same rhythms, if you squint the pitch could almost be the same one from Carrick. Always worried about what I’d talk to these Dublin heads about but I ﬁnd myself having the same conversations with these lads as the ones back home.
								</p>
								<p>
									That small bit of familiarity helps me face the rest of my week; busy but still ﬁlled with unknowns. Classes between nine to ﬁve Monday to Friday. Introductory geography classes where they talk to you like you’re an alien from the far reaches of space - which, for me, is useful. GEO10030 - People, Places, Regions. GEO10055 - Humans and the Environment Throughout Space and Time. Far out. Taking down every single syllable out of the lectures mouth the ﬁrst week and settling for about half of it the following weeks. Doing it right this time.

								</p>
								<p>
									Hour breaks in between for study, assignments, talking rubbish outside lecture halls, trips to Centra for chicken ﬁllet rolls. Mayo, lettuce, and tomato every time, and a can of Sprite. This lad Vinny has started calling me the Creature of Habit which I hoped wouldn’t stick - but it has, and I’ll never admit it to the lads but it feels good to be known enough to have a nickname.
								</p>
								<p>
									Out on Wednesday and Friday nights to the nightclubs, and any other night I can get away with. These are the most unreliable parts of the routine - anything can happen. Different places every night, different people every time. But a routine begins to emerge here too, some sort of structure to contain the chaotic element. Drinking in the student residences til some poor soul of an RA has to become our villain and kick us out. Staggering into the nightclubs until those of us who are drunk enough to realise what horrible places they are leave, while those lucky bastards who are drunk enough to enjoy it sally on into some questionable decisions.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is a wildness I never had back home. I drink a bit but I don’t like to lose control. Prefer to watch everyone else explode around me. It’s fair entertaining, and I’m always able to remind them of their crimes the next morning when they can’t remember.
								</p>
								<p>
									Film club screenings Tuesdays night and meetings Thursday mornings. Science society right after on a Thursday and regular events on Mondays. Student union meetings throughout the week. Political organising on a Saturday, when I have the time. Was never much into politics before but this war in Iraq craic sounds fairly stupid. Met this one Alicia at a rally who wants us to do a radio show together.
								</p>
								<p>
									This schedule keeps me moving and rolling over and through different moods and personalities, but it keeps me from thinking about back home so I’m throwing myself into it. I can’t move fast enough.

												<h3><b>February 3, 2007</b></h3>
												<p>
													The last year. Where the fuck did that come from? Snuck up on me like an assignment due date. I’m viewing the end of this year with a similar feeling of nausea. Like I haven’t done near enough. But I’ve kept busy. Working parttime at Harvey Normans off campus. Shite fucking craic with a group of pricks but it puts money in my pocket. And I’m only there two days of the week. Miss a few classes for my Monday shift but I make it up just about. Still counting down the days til I can leave. On the positive side I can offer girls deals on dining tables, chairs and stools, cabinets, DVD players and much more, see in store for details! This tactic is rarely successful. Vinny calls me Go, Harvey, Go now and I want to hit him.
												</p>
												<p>
													The rest of my schedule is as hectic as ﬁrst year. Dicey’s on a Tuesday (always shite). Workman’s on a Wednesday (50-50 chance of shite). Dtwo’s on a Thursday (pure shite with occasional showers of dry shite). Pub crawling on a Friday (shite clearing up with occasional craic spells), usually, and Hangar on a Saturday. Alicia gets us some x on the odd weekend, just so we aren’t abusing the alcohol too much. Variety is the spice bag of life, as Vinny is fond of slurring to me at 3:30 on a Thursday morning. This one he likes always goes to Workman’s and he always gets blitzed due to the nerves. An unhealthy relationship with substances, as I’m fond of slurring to him while anxiously rolling something at 4:19 on a Thursday morning.
												</p>
												<p>
													Yeah, the college work goes by the wayside. But I’ve worked last minute essay panic attacks into my regular schedule, so I can handle it. They say the best two thousand-word essays are composed in under thirty-eight minutes and are about 80% quotations. I get everything in on time, don’t I? Been to about half my classes this semester, which is good for me. Sure, when will I have a routine like this again?
												</p>
												<hr />
												<h3><b>October 16, 2009 </b></h3>
												<p>
													Usually in work around nine thirty or so, I’m often late though. Out around ﬁve, or just before. Might smoke a bit, have a Lidl microwave dinner (they have a new roast beef one that tastes like whoever made it almost gave a shit). In my defence neither Mam nor Jamie Oliver have done their jobs correctly and taught me how to cook. After dinner I might go for a few casuals with Alicia and Vinny. Head back to ours and watch a <i>Blue Planet</i> or something. Show us something different. Fucking mad stuff under the sea. Get through a bit more of the weed. Stay up too late for work in the morning but sure, fuck it. Don’t need to be in top form for Harvey Norman’s anyway. Sometimes I catch meself thinking in the Harvey Norman voice and get genuine fucking scared. It’s only for the time being anyway.
												</p>
												<p>
													Living for the weekend like one of those motivational cat posters your divorced aunt always emails ye these days. Break out of the bonds of the routine then. Take a tab of something and hit the nightclubs. Run wild around the streets. Getting into ﬁghts over positions we never held until that moment. Doing impressions of one of those blowﬁshes off of Blue Planet that no one else understands. Laughing at jokes we don’t entirely understand. Tell girls in bars that we’re David Attenborough's illegitimate children. Making friends with tomorrows strangers. Screaming and shouting, making and erasing memories almost simultaneously. Recharging something drained by the week and tossing away something accumulated by it, too. <i>Richard Attenborough is my Dad</i>, I <i>swear to fucking God.</i> Thought it was David? <i>Ah, fuck</i>.
												</p>
												<p>
													Spend the next day spiralling on the couch and eating a carbon copy of some burger ﬁrst cooked in 1986 freshly delivered by the local chipper. Reading a look of pure disgust in the delivery man’s eyes as he sees my 3:30 pm pyjamas. Worth it though, because these nights deliver some kind of satisfaction my not quite nine-to-ﬁve doesn’t deliver. We take the fourth weekend of every month off the drugs, y’know, so it doesn’t become a habit or anything. Taking something harder every now and then. Only on the odd special occasion. Didn’t believe it could get any harder before. But it does.
												</p>
												<hr />

												<h3><b>June 6, 2013</b></h3>
												<p>
													Find the drug. Use the drug. Then a blank space, a big empty cozy blank space.
												</p>
												<p>
													Repeat <i>ad nauseum.</i> Every day is the exact same, variations on a single droning melody that didn’t offer much room for variation in the ﬁrst place. Vinny has a lead, or Alicia has a lead. We’re all sick of the sight of each other at this stage.

												</p>
												<p>
													Scrap some money together, somewhere, always eventually ﬁnding something. Pay the bills somehow, pay the rent somehow. Owing money to almost everyone we know. Sometimes not paying the rent but always ﬁnding some new place to disintegrate in. Every time panicking that last time really was the last time, that this is the one where the wheels ﬁnally come off and the whole thing reaches the inevitable crater we all know we’re careening towards. Secretly hoping that it will ﬁnally all fall apart and be over. Unable to truly believe that it could be over, that there could be anything else.
												</p>
												<p>
													But somehow, we always keep going, for another couple seconds, minutes, hours. Years have passed this way. I do not allow myself to count how many. Keep searching, keep scrapping. Find, consume, ﬁnd consume. We have regressed to hunter-gatherers. Don’t stop to think what's next beyond the next step - ﬁnding it or using it. No future, no past. Only this. Haven’t spoke to Mam in a few weeks - wait, let me check my phone - ﬁve months? When did that happen?
												</p>
												<p>
Place is a kip. Place is always a fucking kip. Where am I going to ﬁt cleaning in, or anything else? I’m swamped.
												</p>
												<hr />

												<h3><b>April 9, 2017 </b></h3>
												<p>
													I divide the day into breaths. One in, one out. On the good days, activities grow in the cracks between each. I count ten breaths, I walk into an NA meeting. I count thirty breaths, I might get ﬁve hours of sleep. I get up very early these days. In the end, breath was the only thing I could depend on to come with any regularity. So I set everything by them - trying to build the bones of a routine around them, that soft pull in, that emptying release out. I go for a run three times a week now. I am awed by the size of this achievement and ashamed that something so small has come to mean so much to me.
												</p>
												<p>
													Also reached a point where I can eat three times a day, almost every day. These are the events I can plan around. They are easy to manage and see coming. Mam comes by for dinner twice a week. Go to the cinema the odd time. Coffee with my sponsor now and then. Therapy once a week. Still getting used to this. What’s to tell? It’s the same old story.
												</p>
												<p>
													Texted Alicia when I saw <i>Blue Planet 2 </i>was coming out. She didn’t text me back.
												</p>
												<p>
													I’m left with a lot of time to myself, unfortunately, which I attempt to ﬁll with cooking or cleaning. Maybe a phone call if I’m feeling adventurous. I keep ringing Vinny out of habit, before I even know what I’m doing, sometimes even get through the dial tone before I realise the size of the mistake I have made, stumbling through a wrong number conversation, sorry, sorry, well right number, wrong time, sorry… Few minutes of deep breathing after that.
												</p>
												<p>
On the bad days old things begin to crowd around again. The old routines. So I focus on the new one. In, out. In, out. Dependable. Like clockwork.
												</p>
