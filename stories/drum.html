							<h2>Writing to the Drum Beat</h2>
							<p>By Jack Taheny/p>

								<p>
									So he walked home from work, right down the hill where the old man collected the ﬂoored cigarette butts. On the third street over there were the two Rottweilers that scared him just as much as the ﬁrst day, despite being chained up so far out of reach. So he crossed over to avoid them like he always did, looking back at the sound of each bark. Taking the two letters he dropped them into the letterbox outside the post ofﬁce.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was cold, and his hands were tucked well into his jacket pockets. There was a large hole coming through the left pocket. He poked his ﬁnger through it thinking, “I’ll just ﬁx it tomorrow”. Nearing the apartment, he grabbed an eight pack of beer and a few cans of tuna ﬁsh. The thought sickened him but he had better things to do than cook. Maybe tomorrow.
								</p>
								<p>
									His street looked like the kind where families snuggled in by the warmth of a ﬁre, but that was not his world. The key was giving him trouble again. He shoved the weight of his body into the door twice before it gave in. Someday the lock was going to give but he would worry about that when it happened. He was never a man to cause fuss and the lock was just the right side of useless that it didn’t bother him.
								</p>
								<p>
									There was an envelope under the door. He picked it up and took it to his room at the top of the staircase. The air was colder in there than that it was outside. Inside his small kitchenette he opened a tuna can and a beer. He ate the tuna fast, standing over the sink, washing away the ﬁshy taste with his beer. If he had tuna again he’d probably be sick. He would cook some potatoes tomorrow and make something nice, maybe even light a candle on the table.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, he could sit down at his desk, so he brought the rest of the beers and turned on his small dim lamp. He took the envelope out of his pocket and left it at the edge of the table, grabbing a pen and paper to begin writing. This was his favourite part of the day. But tonight there was something about the sound of the wind coming through the gaps in the old windows. The sound cut through him. He ﬁnished a beer and cracked open another. He tried to write but the whistle of the cold wind was so distracting.
								</p>
								<p>
									Just then the ﬂoorboards started to shake, almost making his teeth chatter. The college kid next door started blasting some heavy techno again. The vibrations shook his letter onto the ﬂoor. He picked it up and held it under the lamplight. Beneath the white of the envelope there was the faintness of bold red capital letters. He could guess what it said. He knew that whether he opened it or not he would still be sitting in the exact same seat, drinking the exact same cheap beer and writing what was probably the same story just with a different set of words. The techno became muted; he had heard this song played before. The drumbeat was coming. He opened his ﬁfth beer; it didn’t matter what they thought.
								</p>
								<p>
									He dropped the envelope into his wastebasket and began to write again. The words began to ﬂow well, he was writing to the drum beat and the chair was shaking beneath him. The beer was helping. He wasn’t going to let the wind or the big bold red letters ruin his favourite part of the day. He ﬁnished far after midnight and took down two new envelopes from his top shelf and addressed and sealed them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the morning he woke and lay there listening to the wind seeping in. He walked to the sink and drank a large glass of water. The two sealed envelopes were on the table and he took them with him. As he walked to work he poked his ﬁnger through the pocket in his jacket and thought “I’ll just ﬁx that tomorrow”.
