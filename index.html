          <h2>&quot;<i>Your talk</i> &quot;, I said, &quot;<i> is surely the handiwork of wisdom, because not one word </br>
              of it did I understand</i>&quot; -O&apos;Brien </h2>
          <p>Some quip. I wondered what wisdom there was in having the brass
            to call this journal, &quot; <i>literary</i> &quot;, but I needn&apos;t have worried once the first few
            submissions came in. After numerous, spluttering stop-starts, the pieces began
            to flow and out of it came what is here&apos;th&apos;be&apos;there&apos;now The Mouldy Bike.
            There is a certain wisdom in naming your novel, piece or whatever have you
            after the work is done. I can&apos;t remember heeding this with The Mouldy Bike, to
            be honest. The name of the journal and its contents are, I think anyway, in
            concord together, the earliest pieces received almost informing the spirit of
            the editorial.
            Two things were very humbling. One, sifting through the quality of
            the work that make up the finished article was incredible, there&apos;s some
            brilliant humour and honesty in the pieces. Two, the endless patience of
            Matt, Orla, Ruth, Gally, Sam and more. I owe ye big time boys and girls!
            Alack, I&apos;m going to leave it there because you need to get going on
            these literary steamboats. I may have bored you already. But stay awhile
            longer! This is the good stuff. It blew me away and it will blow you away too.
            We will be back again in the coming months for some more Mouldy Bike
            adventures, so don&apos;t read them too fast! Here is a presentation of the young
            Irish talent out there that is oftentimes disappointingly underrepresented.
            Oh, and we are running a little competition. To the person who can
            find the most typos in the following pieces, we will reward you with a non-redeemable &euro;100 voucher for O&apos; Nolan&apos;s Bicycle Emporium who have
            branches in every county town in the country as per the latest<b> So You&apos;re Tracing
              Your Irish Roots (1987)</b>, with which you can recklessly spend on a variety of
            pedal-propelled-paraphernalia;</br> &quot <i> Saddle-up and Get Your Asses Down to O&apos;
              Nolan&apos;s Bicycle Emporium</i> &quot. To the runner-up, you shall be richly rewarded
            with a position at The Mouldy Bike Press, as an Intern Editor. Your
            publishing career looks green. </br><b> Good luck!</b> </p>
