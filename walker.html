								<p>I walk over the bridge every morning. I was unlucky with my timetable this semester- all nine or ten o&apos;clock lectures, except for Friday. This particular morning was a Friday; I had an assignment due the following week, so I was going into the library to get started on it. It was cold, a sharp breeze blowing up under my shirt. I wasn&apos;t wearing what I usually wear during the week: thick leggings, hoodie, raincoat, runners. I had made an effort this morning because I was planning to meet Simon later in the evening. I wasn&apos;t dressed for the weather. My new leather jacket, a denim skirt and the yellow shirt my mother got me a few weeks ago. Yellow isn&apos;t really my colour, it washes me out. It was expensive though, so I feel bad if I don&apos;t wear it. I had done my make-up and my bronzer gave me just enough of a glow to pull off the shirt&apos;s mustard tone.  </p>

								<p>Some winter mornings, it&apos;s all you can do to stay straight on the path, the wind is that strong coming up off the Corrib. I often picture myself being picked up and thrown over the side by a sudden violent gust, if it caught me in the split second that both my feet were off the ground between hurried steps. I doubt if it&apos;s possible, but I think about it all the same. I don&apos;t know how strong the currents are here- people tend to go to Spanish Arch to jump where the water really gathers momentum, released into the Atlantic after being conﬁned to the canal for so long. Someone jumped off this bridge a few weeks ago though. You wouldn&apos;t think it was deep enough. I saw the ﬁre brigade and a Garda car parked alongside the bank on the college side of the river on my way to class. I don&apos;t think they found the person.
 </p>
 <p>
	I was walking fast to warm up. I didn&apos;t have my head down, as I often do, forehead thrusting against the ﬂecks of rain, unable to look left or right, just keeping going and hoping to reach the other side soon. There really is a beautiful view from up here, when you can take your time and look at it. The bridge splitting the city from the open countryside- campus buildings and the shopping district in Terryland downriver, upriver marshy land thickening to scrub as far as you can see. At night-time, this part is just darkness, like the opening to a massive drain. Black water, black sky, one lonely ﬂood-light above the GAA grounds at Daingean. On this day, the river was only a few shades greyer than the sky, which was a dirty white. A pale sun somewhere behind it, cloud cover so complete that if it was your ﬁrst day on the earth you might be surprised to hear that the normal colour of the sky is blue. I had been walking behind her on the bridge from the point where the Dyke Road crosses underneath. She had come up the steps from the underpass as I approached, and she nipped in front, all business.
 </p>
 <p>
	 She was very well put together in that effortless way some girls have. Where the borderline of each separate item of clothing seems to blend seamlessly into the next and then attach to the rings of exposed skin around the wrists and ankles like one ﬁnished garment. Well put together, but generic of course. Blue skinnies on long thin legs with the frayed hem that&apos;s in at the moment, black ankle boots with a thick heel that made her calves seem even slimmer. An oversized maroon jacket and a thick wobusol scarf of autumnal colours, the back of which was ﬂung casually over her shoulder. A large cream tote bag tucked under her arm, the spiral binding of a reﬁll pad sticking out the top. I used to envy such style. I don&apos;t anymore, though I can appreciate it. She had caramel and amber highlighted hair, expensive looking. It was not cut into a shape, long and brushed to a shine. Stray sections had escaped from under the scarf and hung with natural straightness down her back. I knew without seeing her face that it would be beautiful. Sometimes you see a ﬁgure that looks remarkable from the back, only to be disappointed when they turn around and there is something about the nose, crudely shaped, or eyes that are just too small or too close together. Such things can&apos;t be corrected with make-up, except maybe in dark nightclubs or with the right sort of light in a photo. Even so, guys can tell the real from the fake, gravitating naturally towards the more perfect symmetry, the pure line of a cheekbone that doesn&apos;t even need the contouring underneath.
 </p>
 <p>
	 It has occurred to me before, walking across this bridge, that I rarely see the same person twice. And yet, given the regularity of each individual&apos;s college timetable and the fact that we each go back and forth, morning and evening, to the same houses for the duration of the college year, I must pass the same people at more or less the same time on any given day. That thought led me to think about something else. The face that is strange to us might know our own in a way we&apos;d never guess. They may have seen us in the bathroom of a pub and noticed some detail that made us stick in their memory. We may have been introduced before and we don&apos;t remember, but they do. They might sit a few tables down from us in the library, where people tend to sit in the same places, and note from afar the stickers on our laptop, how we always sit at the window and leave every forty minutes for a cigarette break. And Facebook knows by virtue of our friend lists and the pages we follow, by our clicks and likes, to suggest certain people to us. “Do you know? -” Followed by a selection of faces with names underneath, an easily accessible database of all the people around us that we do not know and that do not know us, yet. The possibilities for these one-sided encounters are endless.

 </p>
<p>
	As a matter of fact, I had indeed seen this girl in front of me a few times before. I spotted her on the bridge for the ﬁrst time a month or two ago. As I said, I don&apos;t have class on a Friday, but I had a meeting with my supervisor to talk about an upcoming essay. The Culture of Surveillance in East Germany in the years 1961-89. I had a vague idea about what I might write about, but no speciﬁc thesis. It had been the ﬁrst time I&apos;d gone to college on my day off. She was walking with a friend, that day. Both had suitcases, so I assumed they had early classes and then went straight from college to the bus stop.
</p>
<p>
	When Simon told me the morning after we slept together that he had a girlfriend, it was a slap in the face. I had been drinking with friends the evening before and ended up in the nightclub. We stumbled across each other, literally- I had just bought a drink and was on the way to the bathroom to wash down a pill with it. He was shouting something to someone behind him and walked straight into me, knocking my drink to the ﬂoor. He was very apologetic, very good-looking. His pupils were huge so I knew he was on something too. I made a little fuss about the drink, laughing, making it known to him that I wanted a replacement. He obliged and I slipped the pill at the bar then, not wanting to lose sight of him. We hit it off straight away and I think that his initial friendliness to me was not just the result of the MDMA, although the ﬂirting may have been. He has sworn to me many times since then that he has never been unfaithful before, and I believe him. You don&apos;t cheat on your girlfriend for just any girl, or at least, guys like him don&apos;t.
</p>
<p>
	We left together when the club closed. He had, at my encouragement, taken another bomb and I was still up. We walked the streets huddled together, talking about silly things and laughing at one another. We had not kissed yet, but I knew it would happen. He came across as shy and even nervous, which I wondered at given his looks. I suppose that even then, he was trying to talk himself out of what he wanted to do and knew was wrong. I suggested that we go back to my house. I was living in the centre at that time, so it made sense. We could go back and listen to some music; we wouldn&apos;t be able to sleep for a few hours anyway. He kept saying he should ﬁnd his friends, but he didn&apos;t seem to want to leave. The moment we started in that direction, the moment, in fact, that he spilled my drink, a course of events was set in motion that neither of us could have stopped. The sex was a joke that night, of course. You wouldn&apos;t even call it sex, just enthusiastic scrabbling, an extended and beautifully heightened sensation of touch. We laughed about it; we were comfortable with each other from the get-go. We calmed down as it began to get bright, teeth chattering, and smoked a joint before wrapping ourselves up in the single duvet and dozing in and out of ﬁtful sleep.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;d had moderately enjoyable relationships before this, but no boy had quite made me feel the way he did that night. He knew the ﬁne line between jibe and insult and I enjoyed the challenge, enjoyed giving it back to him. It was playful and fun, there was no seriousness to it and yet there was. The whole time at the bar, in the cold streets, on the couch in my living room. When we woke up the next day he disappeared into the bathroom for a long time. I couldn&apos;t hear anything, but I&apos;ve often pictured him in there, sitting on the closed toilet seat with his head in his hands, wondering what to do. When he came out and sat at the end of the bed and told me about her, I started to doubt the authenticity of the connection. Whether it had only been the drugs and nothing else, not my own attractiveness, no real desire on his part. I saw it as a burden too, my complicity in what he had done wrong. But I see that now for the paradox it is. You can&apos;t be said to be complicit in something if you aren&apos;t made aware of the stakes beforehand.
</p>
<p>
	He said he didn&apos;t know what he had done and that he was very, very sorry. He loved her, he had been with her for three years and they were happy together. I told him I didn&apos;t understand either. I really laid it on. How he had made me that girl, the girl who destroyed another girl&apos;s life. Well, worse things even than that. I told him how (which was risky, but which paid off in the end) I liked him. I somehow knew, even then, that he had found something unexpected that night with me too, that girlfriend or no he was changed. Still, he left it at that and for a few weeks afterwards, the incident played on my mind. We had agreed that ﬁrst morning not to look each other up on Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. I didn&apos;t add him and he didn&apos;t add me. We didn&apos;t even exchange numbers. So there was a good chance of our never meeting again. But we did.
</p>
<p>
I had almost convinced myself that it was simply an unfortunate situation and that to dwell on it any longer would be stupid when I ran into him in a cafe in Dominick Street. We had a coffee together, intending to put the whole thing to bed. It had been hanging over him ever since, he said, he had not told his girlfriend and he didn&apos;t plan to. After that, it started as casual meet-ups in cafes, or to smoke a joint by the river. We both stayed in the city weekends, whereas most of our friends went home. Neither of us mentioned these meetings to anyone else. Our friend groups did not collide, but the city is small. After a month, we slept together again. He never speaks about her. I don&apos;t think she sleeps with him enough, I think that might be it. I&apos;m not the kind of person to ask questions, to ask him to leave her. It isn&apos;t my place. And I don&apos;t think I love him either, but I do like that he likes it so much that he cannot stay away.
</p>
<p>
	His protectiveness of their relationship is understandable, and it doesn&apos;t bother me except that sometimes I would wonder what she has that I don&apos;t. Someone else might have gone looking straight away but I held off. It was none of my business. I had to be disciplined about it. Then an acquaintance mentioned his name and hers together one time, and I heard this guy say how hot she was. I was curious to see what she looked like. She really is gorgeous, though some of the photos have been touched up. I couldn&apos;t see all of her pictures and I didn&apos;t want to stay on her page too long in case Facebook, in typical fashion, suggested me as a potential friend for her.
</p>
<p>
	So I suppose it would be more accurate to say that I had recognised her, when I saw her walking along the bridge that ﬁrst time, because I knew what she looked like even before then. When I saw her, saw the photos come to life, it had an effect on me that I hadn&apos;t expected, a kind of sadness tinged with anger. She came up those steps, just like today, but wearing a pair of sculpting leggings that showed off her ass, a vintage bomber jacket, a hat that clasped her hair and fanned it out neatly to the sides. I didn&apos;t know it was her until she turned to say something to the girl beside her and her side proﬁle ﬂashed in the gap between their shoulders.
</p>
<p>
	Figuring after two more Fridays that she seemed to cross the bridge to college at roughly the same time, I found myself leaving the house early enough to catch her. In fact, making the effort to go to the library at the end of the week even when I had no classes did wonders for my college workload and left the rest of the weekend pretty much free. I wish I had got into the habit sooner- it would have made my ﬁrst few years far less stressful. These days, I always have my assignments in on time and the required reading completed for the following week. Just that one little change, those extra hours. It&apos;s funny, how these things come about. This has been one of the most productive semesters I&apos;ve ever had. After the initial unpleasant feeling I had when I saw her ﬁrst, I noticed something strange. Arriving in college and seeing her off at a safe distance before making my way to my usual spot in the library, I ﬁnd a sort of calm comes over me. I am focused. I sit, open the laptop and keep going for three or four hours. I take a break for lunch, come back and do another three hours before heading home again. I make lists and tick everything off. Like clockwork. I&apos;ll see Simon then in the evening or else Saturday evening. We always meet in my house now. There is no room for carelessness in a situation like this, not at this stage. There have been weekends when it&apos;s just not possible, of course. Sometimes he goes and stays with her family or his own. If I don&apos;t see him there&apos;s always a sort of empty feeling for the few days I&apos;m here on my own that no amount of socialising can ﬁll.
</p>
<p>
	So at half eight in the morning on this Friday I&apos;m talking about, I was walking behind her and she didn&apos;t have a suitcase with her. It gave me a little bit of a shock, to see that she did not have a suitcase- she usually goes home on the weekends and Simon had not said anything to the contrary. I wondered whether she was, in fact, staying in Galway for the weekend and what that meant for me. I was aware for the ﬁrst time how wide her hips were. It&apos;s a little detail like that, those wide hips tapering softly into narrow well-shaped legs, that makes all the difference between good and great. I&apos;ve said that I had been walking fast to try and keep warm, and I had to pull back my pace a few times so that I didn&apos;t pass her out or bump into her.
</p>
<p>
	I often wondered whether she had ever noticed me before. She didn&apos;t know me, of course, but had she ever seen me for a split second and then looked back? Not knowing that I was riding her boyfriend every week. I doubted it, but the idea gave me a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach whenever I thought about it. Not fear, but something almost like it, something that felt good. I guessed that she was the kind of girl who was oblivious to most of what went on around her unless it did not relate directly back to her. The kind who was conditioned, from experience, to expect anything of possible importance to simply ﬁnd its way into the gravitational pull of her beauty. Of course she did not suspect that he was cheating. Why would she? And why, why on earth would he cheat?
</p>
<p>
	This funny feeling- I think it is related to that odd calmness I derived from walking with her to college. Walking behind her with the certainty that she had no idea who I was, although we were connected more intimately than she could imagine. The same thing that was inside her during the week was inside me regularly too. Perhaps it was in me more, judging by how long our fucking lasted. Did that make him more mine than hers? It&apos;s a very deﬁnite sort of power, this feeling, I won&apos;t deny. I think, but I am not sure, that it had been growing in intensity each week. The suddenness of the compulsion that came over me on that morning couldn&apos;t have come out of nowhere. As we approached the middle of the bridge I got the idea.
</p>
<p>
	Maybe it was triggered by the fact that she did not have a suitcase today, that Simon had not replied to my text that morning about meeting up, that he had been distant to the point of coldness the last three times we had met up. The comment he made about being disgusted with himself after we slept together the previous week… I suppose I had thought about doing it before. But it had only been a comforting sort of fantasy that crept up now and then, the thoughts of the uses the information I had could be put to. And I knew, of course, that it was destructive and would mean the end of it all. Perhaps that&apos;s why I wanted to do it, to get there ﬁrst. To have a say in the matter, to be the one to conclude what, when you really look at it, had begun without my consent. It would throw me into territory from which there would be no return. As I approached her from behind, my hand reaching to tap her shoulder, I savoured those seconds, imagining confusion turning to shock turning to- tears? A slap? Probably nothing so melodramatic. And then, right before she turned around- how will it feel, I wondered, to see the look on her face when I tell her.
