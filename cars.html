							<h2>Cars and Dismissal</h2>
							<p>By Leah Keane</p>
						</header>
						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner">
							<p>
								Where some families have a dining room<br />to talk about big issues, the Keane family has the car.
							</p>
							<p>
							Not one car necessarily, different ones<br /> over the years, each one slightly less shitty than the last,
							</p>
							<p>
								and the thing is<br />  that you’re in cars a lot,<br /> so it could happen at any time really.
							</p>
							<p>
								Maybe one trip you’re just in the mood<br /> to talk to your Mam about the fact that you love boobs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Or a bit drunk, she’s driving you home from the pub <br />and it slips out — that you really really like it when girls get their nips out.
							</p>
							<p>
								You see the real thing is<br /> that you don’t believe in big issues <br />and you often talk in monotone,
							</p>
							<p>
								so it’s quite likely that this is how the conversation would go:
							</p>
							<p>
								“Well.”
							</p>
							<p>
								“Well.”
							</p>
							<p>
								“Were ye busy today?”
							</p>
							<p>
								“Ah. It was alright.”
							</p>
							<p>
								Seat belts on then silence for ten minutes.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are some poorly kept bushes on a roundabout.
							</p>
							<p>
								It reminds you of your own poorly kept bush.
							</p>
							<p>
								“Mam, I think I’m gay.”
							</p>
							<p>
								I don’t think she’d mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								One night she was drunk, <br />  ended up coming home at around three o’ clock. <br /> I was in bed in my brother’s room downstairs<br />  because I thought I heard mice in the attic.
							</p>
							<p>
								I heard her rummaging around in the kitchen for a while.<br />  Then she was on the phone with someone,<br />  so she went outside the backdoor to have a smoke — <br /> a habit of hers since I can remember.
							</p>
							<p>
								Later she must have noticed <br />that an extra light was on downstairs,<br /> so in she came and sat down<br /> half on top of me by the edge of the bed.
							</p>
							<p>
								And oh how she lamented.<br /> She’d had a horrible lovers’ quarrel<br /> with her partner of nearly twenty years — <br />a retired Eircom installation man, <br />who loves taking her out to dinner on Strand Hill<br /> and talking about his bladder and the neighbours.
							</p>
							<p>
								And I said, “Sure you’ll get back together.”
							</p>
							<p>
								“No, no. Not this time.”
							</p>
							<p>
								She let out a drunken sigh.
							</p>
							<p>
								“Promise me, Leah that when you get a bit older<br />  you’ll marry a nice, rich man who’ll take care of yo<br /> u and then you’ll never have to work a day in your life. <br />  A man…
							</p>
							<p>
								or a woman, I don’t care, as long as you’re happy.”
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course they got back together two weeks later,<br /> but those words gave me enough <br /> to make me feel secure.

							</p>
							<p>
								The Keane family has the car for big issues.<br /> Like that time when I was nine<br /> And Mam told me that Nana was dying.
							</p>
							<p>
								Out she came with it, in a calm, sympathetic voice, “Leah,<br />  Nana’s very sick and she’s not going to get better.”
							</p>
							<p>
								I had been sitting in the back seat,<br />  and when I started crying <br /> she urged me to come crawl into the front<br /> where she hugged me very gently against her<br /> with one arm around my shoulders<br /> and the other resting ﬁrmly on the wheel —<br /> all the while she never stopped driving.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m not worried about being excommunicated,<br /> not from any church or even from my own family.<br /> I suppose my biggest fear is dismissal.<br /> You always hear talk about “phases”,<br /> and as someone who has seemingly no solid foundations for what I feel, <br />that fear is all too legitimate.<br />  I’ve never kissed a girl or even been in a proper relationship.
							</p>
							<p>
								So the problem is, <br />how does one communicate a fact without any sources?

							</p>
							<p>
								It’s more difﬁcult.<br /> She’ll ask, “Well, where’s this woman then?” <br />and I’d rather avoid all that.
							</p>
							<p>
								So should I come out now<br />  or wait until I’ve met a girl<br /> who’d like to drink tea with me <br />and watch bad TV.
							</p>
							<p>
								A girl who’s sweet enough not to cringe<br /> when she reads my poetry,<br /> and would not be opposed<br /> to having sex in weird places
							</p>
							<p>
								Or drinking in quiet bars<br /> that play the Rolling Stones,
							</p>
							<p>
								And if you haven’t dismissed me yet,<br /> I promise to propose as soon as I get my car.
							</p>
